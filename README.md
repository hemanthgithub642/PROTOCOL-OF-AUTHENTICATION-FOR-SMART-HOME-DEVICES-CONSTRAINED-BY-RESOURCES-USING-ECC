# PROTOCOL-OF-AUTHENTICATION-FOR-SMART-HOME-DEVICES-CONSTRAINED-BY-RESOURCES-USING-ECC
Review 1 : We implement security statitics and use case analysis to analyze the problem identifications 

Review 2 : We gathered important security protocols information and make a dynamic protocol design to implement in security communication protocol between device and internet    

Review 3 : To integrate with security flaws and analyzed the security implementations with competetive analyzed to mitigate vulnerabilities.
